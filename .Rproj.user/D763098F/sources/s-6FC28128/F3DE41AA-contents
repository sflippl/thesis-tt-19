# Discussion

In this dissertation, mice were trained on a novel sensorimotor task relating their licking behaviour to continuous auditory feedback. This dissertation focussed on analysing the acquired behavioural data, and the cortical representation in mouse M10 during one day of imaging. These data demonstrate that five out of nine analysed mice (including M10) learned the sensorimotor contingency and they suggest that the contingency was represented by neurons of the primary auditory cortex.

## Behavioural evidence for task acquisition

In the novel behavioural task, the mouse could manipulate the frequency of the presented tone sequence by licking one of two spouts. They were rewarded with a small drop of water if they moved the stimulus into a particular frequency region. At any given time, the spout the animal should lick was therefore determined by the presented stimulus.

Mouse M10 reacted to the presented stimuli by increasing its lickrate in the corresponding direction. Due to the continuous integration between motor behaviour and subsequent stimulus presentation, however, a motor-driven policy (i.e. switching every few seconds between left and right lick bouts) would allow the animal to receive plenty of rewards under the regular contingency. The resulting behavioural pattern would be indistinguishable from a behavioural pattern emerging from a sound-driven policy. Whereas the reaction of M10 to the normal paradigm was therefore a necessary condition for a sound-driven policy, it was not sufficient evidence.

Importantly, this analysis suggests that the policy was at least in part driven by the presented stimuli. It might, however, also have included a learned motor pattern.

The analysis does not allow for a distinction between two alternative sound-driven policies. On the one hand, the data could be explained by an associative mechanism whereby the animal learned to lick into a certain direction as a response to the presented sounds, but did not take into account how this licking behaviour changed this stimulus presentation. On the other hand, an integrated mechanism would propose that the animal learned to navigate in a one-dimensional tonespace using left and right licks, and used this rule to reach a rewarded frequency region. The manner in which the task was constructed aimed to make the implementation of an integrated (rather than associative) sound-driven policy more likely. In particular, this was the reason why the contingency was not presented in a trial-based manner, as this would have led the animal to focus on purely learning a behavioural response to a presented stimulus. In contrast, the continuous task approach allowed the animal to move freely in this integrated virtual environment, and to be in near-complete control of its sensory feedback. How the two sound-driven policies could be distinguished using both acquired data and further variations of the experiment will be discussed below. 

## Auditory cortex represents the artificial sensorimotor contingency

Sensory cortex has been found to change its tuning properties in accordance with task demands, allowing for enhanced perceptual discrimination as well as qualitative changes in the representation of task-related stimuli [@jeanne2013associative; @peron2015whiskers; @chu2016balancing]. In order to investigate the role of sensory areas of the cortex in task acquisition, we recorded from neurons in auditory cortex of mice while they were engaged in the task. In this dissertation, one example session in M10 was analysed.

Neurons in auditory cortex encode a reduced representation of stimulus history [@rubin2016representation]. In order to control for this effect regular stimuli were compared to contingency violations that were otherwise fully matched in recent sensory statistics. On a population level, the representation of these sounds was significantly different. Single-neuron analysis revealed that this effect was driven by a strong difference in the responses of a small proportion of recorded neurons.

Furthermore, the analysis suggested possible mechanisms by which this representation might operate. In particular, the tuning curves derived from perturbed sounds appeared broader than the regular tuning curves. This is consistent with a model where certain neurons represent a mixture of expected and presented sounds, shifting their responses away from the presented sounds in the event of an unexpected event. In particular, one example neuron exhibited exactly this kind of pattern: Compared to its best-frequency it fired more strongly in response to a perturbation leading to a lower-frequency stimulus if the expected sound was higher and vice versa.

A clearer picture of these representational patterns will be determined using further imaging data. With a larger sample size, it would for example be possible to estimate a mathematical model of how neurons in auditory cortex represent quantities related to the sensorimotor contingency such as expected frequency and prediction error.

## Implications of the behavioural and neural analysis

Combined, behavioural and neuronal evidence suggests that it is possible to train head fixed mice on a behavioural task that is based on an artificial sensorimotor contingency, leading to a cortical representation of this contingency. From a computational perspective, such a task has important implications for general theories of sensorimotor learning and intelligence. Methodologically, the fact that this computationally rich task can be applied to head fixed mice means that its neural correlates can easily be studied using 2-photon imaging and other techniques that currently cannot be applied to freely moving animals.

As a next step, the behavioural data in the other animals will be analysed to determine whether they have learned the task. Furthermore, the representation of the contingency and the manner in which sensory and motor evidence are integrated will be investigated within the available neuronal dataset. Below, I will elaborate on how the collected data can be used for such investigations and propose extensions of the task paradigm that would shed light on questions that are currently not within reach.

In computational theories of intelligence, solving more complex tasks often involves a tradeoff between two important principles of learning.

On the one hand, by extracting statistical patterns from our environment, we learn about the information we should take into account to solve these tasks. This applies to sensory statistics as well as sensorimotor contingencies. The general smoothness of objects can be used to parse information at subneuronal [@srinivasan1982pc] and neuronal level [@rao1999pc]. This representation is apparent in all sensory modalities [@fox2005comparison; @smith2006efficient] and is sensitive to artificial manipulations of sensory statistics [@wood2016chick; @wood2018chick]. In a sensorimotor context, corollary discharges allow for sensory consequences of motor behaviour to be cancelled out. This is mediated, in part, by auditory cortex [@schneider2014discharges] and is sensitive to artificial contingencies, as well [@schneider2018cortical]. 

On the other hand, the ultimate goal of neuronal processes is to generate appropriate behaviour. Following this perspective, the brain should gradually discard task-irrelevant information to optimize behavioural output. This idea is reflected in receptive fields in sensory cortex [@hubel1965receptive; @hubel1968receptive; @aertsen1980receptive; @aertsen1981receptive], which can reshape their properties according to task-relevance [@fritz2003rapid], and extends to more complex tasks such as object recognition in the ventral stream [@dicarlo2012visual] and semantic development in humans [@saxe2019semantic].

The presented task lies at the interface of these two theories. On the one hand, the goal of the task is ultimately to receive a reward in the form of water. On the other hand, this goal can more easily be reached by recognizing the sensorimotor contingency. Since neural data suggests that auditory cortex represents this contingency and this area is also involved in shaping behavioural learning, it appears likely that the animal’s behaviour is indeed not only driven by auditory associations, but in particular implements a contingency-driven behavioural policy.

Whether behavioural relevance has an impact on the extraction of sensorimotor contingencies in sensory cortex could be probed by making the rewards only contingent on the number of licks, leading the mice to explore the tonespace in any direction, without direct consequences on the likelihood of reward. This would connect the experiment more closely with the passive presentation of a novel sensorimotor contingency by @schneider2018cortical.

Neurons that are sensitive to pure sensorimotor perturbations are likely implicated in the integration of sensory and motor evidence. Both multisensory and sensorimotor integration processes in the brain are compatible with a Bayesian model and take the uncertainty associated with the different stimuli into account [@wolpert1995internal; @kording2004force; @kording2004bayesian; @oreilly2012bayesian]. In order to test whether the contingency representation in auditory cortex was implicated in a similar mechanism of evidence integration, the sound levels were modulated on some sessions so as to present stimuli with different degrees of uncertainty. These level modulations can be used to probe the purpose of the perturbation-sensitive neurons. As an example, if the neuron in figure \@ref(fig:perturbation)b indeed represents a mixture of the presented and expected sound, the neuron’s tuning curve would be shifted closer to the expected rather than the presented sound for less certain, i. e. more silent auditory input. Extensions of this idea might manipulate precision of the auditory stimuli by increasing their bandwidth or presenting several stimuli at once.

Similarly to the neuronal representation, the existence of an internal model can be tested behaviourally by manipulating the precision of the provided information [@wolpert1995internal]. This would allow for a behavioural examination of whether the mice take the sensorimotor contingency into account when solving the task. The neural evidence of a representation of the contingency in auditory cortex, an area that plays a role in behavioural learning, would suggest that this contingency can affect the mouse’s behaviour as well.

When freely moving rats were presented with a similar tonespace, recordings of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit provided evidence for the emergence of grid cells representing this tonespace [@aronov2017grid]. Grid cells had initially been identified as a neural correlate of invariant spatial behaviour [@hafting2005grid]. More recently, they have also been implicated in non-spatial cognitive tasks [@constantinescu2016grid], which provides support for the hypothesis that conceptual knowledge is organized in ‘cognitive maps’ [@tolman1948map]. The emergence of grid cells in this behavioural task could be tested by determining the anatomical connections of the neurons representing sensorimotor perturbations and subsequently imaging entorhinal cortex in behaving mice [@low2014entorhinal]. Furthermore, grid cells generate a particularly precise error-correcting code compared to classical population codes in sensory cortex [@sreenivasan2011grid]. A better understanding of the representation of sensorimotor perturbations, which require such an error correction, might therefore shed light on the emergence of conceptual grid cells as well. 

For the purpose of dissecting the circuit mediating this potential contingency representation, it would also be important to image inhibitory neurons in auditory cortex, as the proposed mechanism would involve cancelling out predictions from another cortical area [@larkum1999inhibition].

In conclusion, this dissertation presented a new behavioural task for head-fixed mice involving the learning of a novel, continuous auditory sensorimotor contingency. Mice were able to learn this task, and neural data suggest that auditory cortex can represent the corresponding contingency. As a next step, the variations in the collected data will allow for a more detailed examination of the implemented behavioural policy, the representation of the contingency, and the manner by which the sensory and motor evidence is integrated to guide behaviour. Furthermore, variations of the task would allow for an examination of the influence of behavioural relevance on the possible emergence of an abstract tonespace, connecting a simple task in head fixed mice to some of the most debated computational theories of learning.
