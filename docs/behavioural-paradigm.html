<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Sensorimotor task</h3>
<p>The mice were head fixed in front of two spouts that were positioned either side of their snout. Sometimes the spouts were shifted to one side to counteract a bias into one direction. The mice were presented every 500 ms with pure tones that were 200 ms long and between 60 and 65 dB. These tones were centered around 11.3kHz and arranged in six steps per octave. When they were presented with stimuli spanning one octave, these were logarithmically arranged in the space between 8 and 16 kHz. A three octaves space spanned the range from 4 to 32 kHz. By licking the two spouts in front of them, the mice manipulated the frequency that was presented next. For this purpose, the counts nr and nl of right and left licks respectively were determined in either a window of 700 to 200ms or a window of 600 to 100ms before the next stimulus presentation. The current stimulus frequency was subsequently shifted by steps that were determined by rounding the formula</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2\left(\log(n_r+1)-\log(n_l+1)\right)\]</span></p>
<p>to the nearest whole number. These shifts were bounded by the number of octaves in a given trial. Mice were presented either with an RL-contingency such that right licks led to a decreasing stimulus frequency and left licks led to an increasing frequency, or an LR-contingency, in which left and right licks led to decreasing and increasing frequencies, respectively.</p>
<p>When the tone frequency was at most one step away from the middle frequency (i. e. between 10 and 12kHz), mice were presented with a small drop of water (0.005ml) in the spout they had last licked. In order to reach this rewarded region, the stimuli outside of this rewarded region therefore implied the strategy that needed to be employed in order to reach the rewarded region. In the RL-contingency (resp. LR-contingency), frequencies above (resp. below) the rewarded region implied a ‘Rightwards!’ strategy, where the animal needed to lick right, and frequencies below (resp. above) the rewarded region implied a ‘Leftwards!’ strategy, where the animal need to lick the left spout (see figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:a-example-py">1.1</a> for an example of an RL-contingency).</p>
<p>Recorded licks and rewards as well as presented sounds were registered in a text file for offline analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="violations-of-the-contingency" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Violations of the Contingency</h3>
<p>For the purpose of understanding whether the mice had learned the sensorimotor contingency, and whether auditory cortex represented this contingency, targeted violations of the contingency were introduced to decouple sensorimotor dynamics from its confounding factors. When the lick rate was non-zero, random jumps in tone frequency were occasionally being presented, violating the sensorimotor contingency.</p>
<p>Larger jumps led to perturbations in strategy. Without such perturbations, a sound-driven policy would lead to a motor pattern of alternating left and right lick bouts. Such a policy would be indistinguishable from a policy based on a regular motor pattern switching between left and right lick bouts. After a strategy perturbation, an animal implementing a motor-driven policy should employ the same lick pattern as if the perturbation had not occurred, whereas an animal implementing a sound-driven policy should adapt its behaviour accordingly. By comparing the licking behaviour after such an event with the regular licking behaviour, a sound-driven policy could therefore be distinguished from a motor-driven policy. For this purpose, jumps were generate from a uniform distribution including all possible changes.</p>
<p>These large jumps were apparent as sensory oddballs. In the case of smaller jumps, the tones could be matched with tones following the regular contingency for their frequency and sound history (going back one stimulus). If the recorded neurons reacted differently to those tones violating the sensorimotor contingency, this would therefore indicate that these neurons represented the sensorimotor contingency. For this purpose, jumps were randomly generated from the prior distribution of stimulus changes.</p>

<div id="sound-level-modulations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Sound level modulations</h3>
<p>Cortex has been demonstrated in multiple areas to integrate multimodal information according to their respective precision <span class="citation">(Körding and Wolpert, <a href="#ref-kording2004bayesian">2004</a>)</span>. In order to probe the integration of sensory and motor evidence sound levels were decreased by 20 dB in some sessions to manipulate their precision. In these sessions, every stimulus had an equal probability of being represented at a sound level of 40-45 dB or 60-65 dB.</p>
</div>
<div id="training-methods" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Training Methods</h3>
<p>In the beginning, the mice were rewarded for licking the spouts to guide their behaviour into the correct direction. Subsequently, they were presented with a simple version of the behavioural paradigm, where the sounds were presented within one octave and without perturbations. As the animals’ behaviour stabilized this window was extended to two and finally three octaves and strategy perturbations were introduced. To guide their behaviour in the initial stages, rewards were presented outside of the rewarded frequencies if either of the following conditions was satisfied: 1) the animal licked after having not licked for two minutes; 2) the animal licked in the direction that moved it closer to the rewarded frequency region after having not received a reward for ninety seconds. These rewards were omitted from the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="imaging-procedures-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Imaging procedures</h3>
<p>To record from neurons in the auditory cortex, the animals were head fixed in an optically and acoustically isolated imaging booth. During the subsequent imaging preparations, they performed the behavioural task. As a reference position, the microscope was positioned at the surface of the brain and the center of the widefield image. This allowed us to move the microscope to the functional areas of auditory cortex that had been identified using widefield calcium imaging and to find the same areas again across different days. Imaging was performed at planes of 170-250 µm below the surface, corresponding to cortical layers 2/3.</p>
<p>Subsequently, suitable areas for imaging were identified using the functional areas identified by the widefield image, the visibility of the neurons in these areas, and the robustness of their auditory responses. Several areas were recorded on different days to sample from different areas within auditory cortex. After selecting three to four locations in such a manner, these areas were repeatedly imaged throughout the remaining days as long as visibility allowed it. The same imaging location was determined using the reference frame and the brain surface, as well as a mean image of the recorded area to align the microscope between several days.</p>
<p>Imaging blocks of 10 minutes were acquired consecutively as long as the animal behaved sensibly, but never for longer than an hour. In this manner, imaging data were collected for 233 blocks, in total.</p>
