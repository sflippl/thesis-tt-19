<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Acquisition</h2>
<p>This section discusses the behavioural evidence that the mice have learned the sensorimotor contingency. For the purpose of this analysis, this is assumed to be the case if the mice adapt their behaviour in a sensible and sound-driven manner, i. e. animals should lick in a manner that would bring the presented stimulus closer to the rewarded region. In particular, it is not sufficient if their behaviour can be explained by a behavioural policy that is based on a regular motor pattern that is independent of the sounds. It is possible to distinguish a sound-driven policy from such a motor-driven policy using the two groups of stimuli presented below. Based on these groups and focussing on mouse M10, the subsequent sections will discuss the acquisition of the contingency in all animals and the course of learning in M10 alone.</p>
<div id="distinguishing-a-sound-driven-policy-from-a-motor-driven-policy" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Distinguishing a sound-driven policy from a motor-driven policy</h3>
<p>The following paragraphs are going to explain how targeted variations of the task paradigm can distinguish a sound-driven policy from a policy based on learned motor patterns.</p>
<p>At any given time, the spout the animal should lick is determined by the sounds the animal is hearing. In the excerpt shown in figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:a-example-py">1.1</a>, initially the sounds are above the rewarded region, therefore the animal must lick right in order to reach the rewarded region. (Henceforth, such stimuli are called ‘Rightwards!’ sounds.) As the animal employs the correct strategy and licks right, it reaches the rewarded region and is thus presented with a drop of water. As it keeps licking the right spout, the correct strategy changes to ‘Leftwards!’. The mouse switches its lick pattern and is therefore rewarded. Subsequently, the stimulus again changes to a ‘Rightwards!’ sound.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:a-example-py"></span>

Furthermore, green tiles indicate left licks, orange tiles indicate right licks. Blue tiles indicate rewards.
</p>
</div>

<p>Based on the above reasoning we can assess whether the animal’s behaviour is compatible with a sound-driven policy. In the example sequence, this is the case so far. However, it is not clear from this analysis alone that the changing sounds actually determine the lick strategy. Instead, the mouse might have learned a simple motor pattern of alternating between left and right lick bouts (henceforth called a switch policy). An animal simply switching between left and right licking independently of the sounds could nevertheless be regularly traversing the target region and therefore receive plenty of rewards.</p>
<p>By introducing targeted violations of the sensorimotor contingency, it was possible to analyse whether a switch policy alone could account for the behaviour. In some cases, such a violation led to a ‘strategy perturbation’, as can be seen in figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:a-example-py">1.1</a>. By licking left, the animal had reached a ‘Rightwards!’ stimulus. Both a sound-driven and a motor-driven policy would suggest to lick right. However, due to a strategy perturbation, the stimulus suddenly jumps to a ‘Leftwards!’ sound, even though the normal sensorimotor contingency would have led to a ‘Rightwards!’ sound. The motor-driven policy would therefore erroneously suggest to switch and lick right, whereas a sound-driven policy would correctly suggest to not switch and continue to lick left. Strategy perturbations can therefore be used to distinguish between a switch policy and a sound-driven policy.</p>
<p>Of course, a different motor-driven policy could cause the mouse to correctly react to strategy perturbations, namely by continuously licking on one side. However, this policy would fail to provide the mouse with any rewards when no perturbations occur. Only a sound-driven strategy can account for the correct lick pattern in both cases. By comparing the effect of violations that lead to a strategy perturbation to those that do not, it is therefore possible to assess whether the mice have learned the sensorimotor contingency.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Lickrates after a strategy change</h3>
<p>For the purpose of such a comparison, this section will analyze lickrates before and after sounds that imply a change in strategy, as well as before and after strategy perturbations, using M10 as an example. It is important to note that this mouse (like most others) was generally more likely to lick the left than the right spout.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>As figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:strategy-change">1.2</a> demonstrates in the case of mouse M10, a change in strategy is preceded by licking of the opposite spout, as this drives the sound into the corresponding region. Furthermore, it is followed by an increased lick rate in the direction that is suggested by the stimulus. This increase is pronounced for a ‘Leftwards!’ event and more attenuated – but nonetheless present – in the case of a ‘Rightwards!’ event. It begins about 500 ms before the sound that causes a strategy change and reaches its peak within 500 ms after that sound.</p>

<img src="thesis-tt-19_files/figure-html/strategy-change-1.png" alt="The lick rate before and after a sound that changes the appropriate strategy either to ‘Leftwards!’ (upper panel) or ‘Rightwards!’ (lower panel). Data has been averaged across all sessions by M10." width="90%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>

<p>The animal therefore reacted to a strategy change in the appropriate manner. This reaction was either sound-driven or due to a learned switch pattern. In particular, this animal often started an active phase (i. e. a phase with a high lick rate) with a right lick bout that was followed by a left lick bout. In order to investigate whether such a motor pattern can explain away the animal’s behaviour, figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:a-lickrates">1.3</a> visualizes the average lick rates of M10 centered around violations of the contingency that either perturbed the current strategy (henceforth called ‘perturbation’ events, see figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:a-example-py">1.1</a>) or did not perturb the current strategy (‘no perturbation’).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:a-lickrates"></span>

On the left side, events where the sensorimotor contingency led to a ‘Leftwards!’ sound are depicted. In the no-perturbation case, the new sound still suggested a left lick bout. In the case of a perturbation event, the new sound suggested to lick right. On the right side, events where the sensorimotor contingency led to a ‘Rightwards!’ sound are depicted. Similarly, the no-perturbation case does not change this strategy, whereas the perturbation case does." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

The bottom panel shows the lickrate histogram centered around these events for M10. The x axis shows the time centered around stimulus onset and the y axis shows the lickrate. On the left side, events where the sensorimotor contingency led to a ‘Leftwards!’ sound are depicted. In the no-perturbation case, the new sound still suggested a left lick bout. In the case of a perturbation event, the new sound suggested to lick right. On the right side, events where the sensorimotor contingency led to a ‘Rightwards!’ sound are depicted. Similarly, the no-perturbation case does not change this strategy, whereas the perturbation case does.
</p>
</div>

<p>These violations only occurred during periods when the animals were actively engaged in the task, i.e. when the lick rate was non-zero in the immediate past, but were otherwise random. Restricting the analysis to those stimuli that represented a violation of the contingency therefore made the history between perturbation events and no-perturbation events comparable. As expected, the lick rates preceding stimulus onset were similar for both types. The only notable difference is given by an elevated right lick rate in the event of a ‘Leftwards!’ strategy without perturbation.</p>
<p>The behavioural pattern following a no-perturbation event was consistent with the pattern following a strategy change within the sensorimotor contingency. In contrast, a perturbation of the strategy led to an immediate change of the left lickrate into the appropriate direction. If a ‘Leftwards!’ sound changed to a ‘Rightwards!’ sound, the left lick rate that had already started ramping up instantly decreased again. In the case of the reverse change, the left lick rate interrupted its quick decrease and instead increased again. Though less severely, the right lick rate changed in the appropriate manner, as well. The strategy perturbation therefore broke the regular switch pattern.</p>
<p>This response was not driven by random fluctuations. This could be confirmed by using a nonparametric test to compare the lick rates in the second before and after stimulus onset and comparing them between events that led to a strategy change and those that did not (see figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:a-significance">1.4</a>).In three out of four types of events, the licking behaviour of M10 before stimulus onset showed no significant differences between perturbation and no-perturbation events (<span class="math inline">\(U=(8380, 95448, 105208)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = (0.74, 0.20, 0.11)\)</span>). However, for a ‘Leftwards!’ strategy, right lick rates were significantly elevated in the event of perturbations compared to no perturbations (<span class="math inline">\(U=6418\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=0.0025\)</span>).</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.4: The differences in lickrates as a result of perturbation and no-perturbation events and the significance of their difference according to a Mann-Whitney U test.
</p>
</div>

<p>In contrast, after a strategy perturbation, the lickrates into the direction of the perturbation significantly increased when compared to their level during a non-perturbed event in which licks into this direction were not necessary (<span class="math inline">\(U=(9230,111039)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=(0.032, 0.0025)\)</span>). The lickrates into the previous direction decreased in the event of a perturbation, but those changes were not significant (<span class="math inline">\(U=(8814, 102516)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=(0.15, 0.21)\)</span>).</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that lick strategies cannot be fully explained by a motor-driven policy, and are at least partly explained by a sound-driven policy. Therefore, we can conclude that M10 has acquired the sensorimotor contingency.</p>
<p>This analysis can be further summarized by determining and comparing the change in lick rate difference elicited by the different types of events. This change is defined as the difference between the right and left lick rate in the second after stimulus onset compared to the lick rate difference in the second before stimulus onset. A positive (resp. negative) change in lick rate difference therefore suggests that the proportion of right (resp. left) licks was higher following stimulus onset. Compared to regular sounds, strategy perturbations shifted this change in lick rate difference significantly into the correct direction in mouse M10 (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2=13.5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=0.00012\)</span>).</p>

<p>In mouse M10, which performed this task for twenty days, this sound-driven policy emerges over the course of training. By splitting its sessions up into the first (days one to seven) and last (days fourteen to twenty) third, it is possible to study the evolution of the sound-driven policy (figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:course">1.5</a>).</p>

<p>The most important response to strategy perturbations, the increase of the lickrate in the appropriate direction, is not significant in the first seven days (<span class="math inline">\(U=(1141,8050)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=(0.51, 0.91)\)</span>), but is in the last seven (<span class="math inline">\(U=(764,11090)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=(0.03,0.05)\)</span>). In contrast, the left lickrate is already significantly attenuated in the appropriate event within the first seven days (<span class="math inline">\(U=1450\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(p=0.0080\)</span>).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In the last seven days, neither the right nor the left lickrate are significantly attenuated for perturbations that suggest a strategy in the opposite direction (<span class="math inline">\(U=(544,9512)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=(0.80,0.83)\)</span>). Overall, however, the behaviour of M10 can be better explained by a sound-driven policy for the last seven days compared to the first seven days, indicating an improvement in performance over time. This is supported by a Prentice-Wittkowski test applied to the first and the last seven days. While this test is significant in both cases, the test statistic is higher and the p value smaller at the end of the behavioural training (Days one to seven: <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2=3.17\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=0.038\)</span>; Days fourteen to twenty: <span class="math inline">\(\chi=20.8\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p=2.6e-6\)</span>).</p>
<p>By assessing the change in lick rate difference that the four different kinds of strategy perturbations evoke on a daily basis, the emergence of the sensorimotor behaviour over time can be studied in a more detailed manner (figure <a href="acquisition.html#fig:lrd">1.6</a>). If the animal behaves in a sensible manner, this change in lick rate difference should be positive (resp. negative) if the sound suggests a ‘Rightwards!’ (resp. ‘Leftwards!’) strategy. Within the first couple of days, the change in lick rate difference in response to no-perturbation ‘Leftwards!’ events quickly reached a strong negative value. Compared to that the change in lick rate difference in response to no-perturbation ‘Rightwards!’ events rose more slowly. In a perturbed ‘Leftwards!’ event suggesting a right lick bout, the initial response appeared similar to a non-perturbed ‘Leftwards!’ event. Over time, however, compared to the regular reaction, this change in lick rate difference shifted towards a higher proportion of right licks. A similar, but more subtle pattern emerges from the perturbed ‘Rightwards!’ events, as well.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The consistent left bias might be explained by the position of the headbar and the cranial window that was also consistent across all animals. The added weight of these implants require compensatory mechanisms by the animals that might have induced the bias as a side effect.<a href="acquisition.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>It is important to note here that the first seven days contain few perturbations. This might be an explanation for the discrepancy between the overlapping confidence intervals and the significant Mann-Whitney U test, which evaluates a rank sum rather than a difference of means.<a href="acquisition.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
