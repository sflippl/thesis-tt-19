<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Representation</h2>
<p>This section discusses the evidence that auditory cortex represents the sensorimotor contingency. For the purpose of this analysis, this is assumed to be the case if violating the sensorimotor contingency changes the representation of the presented stimulus. In the previous section, the contingency was violated with jumps large enough to induce a strategy change. Auditory cortex represents such sensory oddballs regardless of their relation to the contingency <span class="citation">(Rubin et al., <a href="#ref-rubin2016representation">2016</a>)</span>. This analysis therefore required more subtle sensorimotor violations. To distinguish sensory oddball responses from sensorimotor perturbation responses, events were selected that were matched in terms of sensory statistics, but differed from regular sounds in as far as they violated the sensorimotor contingency. Sensory statistics were assumed similar if the previously and currently presented stimuli were equal across both conditions.</p>
<p>If auditory cortex is sensitive to such subtle perturbations, this would therefore suggest that the area takes motor evidence into account in a contingency-specific manner. By recording single-neuron responses in auditory cortex while the mouse was engaged in the task and occasionally presented with perturbations, it was determined whether auditory cortex was sensitive to violations of the sensorimotor contingency.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Frequency tuned neurons in auditory cortex</h3>
<p>As a first step, neurons were identified that were sensitive to the presented tones. In primary (A1) and secondary (A2) auditory cortex as well as the anterior auditory field (AAF), neurons are globally organized in a topographical manner according to their best frequency, i. e. the sound frequency they respond to most strongly <span class="citation">(Stiebler et al., <a href="#ref-stiebler1997topographic">1997</a>; Bizley et al., <a href="#ref-bizley2005functional">2005</a>; Issa et al., <a href="#ref-issa2014topographic">2014</a>)</span>. Using widefield imaging, the location of the cranial window over auditory cortex was confirmed and the locations of A1, A2, and AAF were determined (figure <a href="representation.html#fig:frequency-tuning">1.7</a>a). While the mice performed the behavioural task, we recorded the activity from individual neurons in layer 2/3 (170-250µm depth) of these regions using 2-photon calcium imaging and determined the deconvolved spike rate using the ‘suite2p’ algorithm <span class="citation">(Pachitariu et al., <a href="#ref-pachitariu2017suite2p">2017</a>)</span>. This section analyses an example session in L2/3 (-205µm) of putative A1 in mouse M10.</p>
<p>After determining the average spike rate in response to a presented stimulus, neuronal frequency tuning was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, a nonparametric version of the analysis of variance <span class="citation">(Kruskal and Wallis, <a href="#ref-kruskal1952">1952</a>)</span>. The neurons with the strongest frequency tuning (<span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.0001\)</span>) were selected for further analysis. Most of the selected neurons showed typical frequency tuning curves (figure <a href="representation.html#fig:frequency-tuning">1.7</a>b,c) and a typical average response to sound presentation (figure <a href="representation.html#fig:frequency-tuning">1.7</a>d), with a mixture of onset and offset responses <span class="citation">(Qin et al., <a href="#ref-qin2007offset">2007</a>; Liu et al., <a href="#ref-liu2019offset">2019</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="sensorimotor-perturbations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Sensorimotor Perturbations</h3>
<p>This section evaluates whether auditory cortex represents the sensorimotor contingency. This would be the case if the stimulus representation was different for sensorimotor perturbations compared to sounds that followed the contingency. In order to control for any neural effects driven by sound history statistics themselves, the responses to sensorimotor perturbations were compared to non-perturbed sounds with matched frequency and stimulus history (going back one stimulus).</p>
<p>A Prentice-Wittkowski test over the full population of frequency-tuned neurons revealed that the spike rates elicited by perturbed stimuli were significantly different from those following non-perturbed stimuli (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2=5.3\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(p=0.02\)</span>). This suggests that the population of neurons recorded in this session indeed represents the sensorimotor contingency. Overall, the neurons appear more broadly tuned in the event of perturbed stimuli, though due to the limited sample size, this is difficult to assess using an averaged tuning curve (figure <a href="representation.html#fig:perturbation">1.8</a>d).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:perturbation"></span>

</p>
</div>

<p>Next, the representation of sensorimotor perturbations was considered at the level of individual neurons. Applying the Prentice-Wittkowski test to single neurons yielded nine out of 69 frequency-tuned neurons with a p value of under 0.05.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This was a higher number than what would have been expected due to random fluctuations: a permutation test with shuffled perturbations led to nine or more perturbation-sensitive neurons in less than 0.02% of the cases (i. e. p=0.0002) (figure <a href="representation.html#fig:perturbation">1.8</a>b). This is further evidence that auditory cortex indeed represents sensorimotor perturbations.</p>
<p>Inspection of the neurons that were the most sensitive to perturbations reveals that in some cases, the perturbation modulated the amplitude of the neuronal response without affecting the frequency tuning, whereas in other cases, the response to sensorimotor perturbations was shifted in frequency. Figure <a href="representation.html#fig:perturbation">1.8</a>e visualizes the average response to a best-frequency stimulus that represents or does not represent a perturbation. In many cases, the perturbation modulates the response, either by making it stronger or weaker. However, other effects can be found as well. In particular, one example neuron showed a broader frequency tuning to sensorimotor perturbations (figure <a href="representation.html#fig:perturbation">1.8</a>f). Indeed, it was particularly sensitive to events whose expected sound was near the best-frequency stimulus, suggesting that it responded to a mixture of the presented and expected sound.</p>
<p>In this manner, inspection of single neurons can shed light on possible mechanisms by which sensorimotor perturbations are represented. The analysis presented here does not allow us to validate or reject such hypothesized mechanisms. At this stage, however, it is possible to confirm that neurons in auditory cortex represented, in some way, sensorimotor perturbations differently from sounds within the contingency.</p>
